# Projectile path
 
This is a program that will print the equation of the projectile path, along with printing the horizontal range, time of flight, and the maximum horizontal range possible with the initial speed. It takes the input for the initial speed and angle of projection from the user, and then calculates the horizontal range, time of flight, and the maximum horizontal range possible with the initial speed. The program also displays the path of the projectile as a graph, with horizontal distance on the x axis and height on the y axis.

Also included is an executable files of the program for Windows, MacOS, and Linux.
